h1. Bonjour-Quick

Simple Bonjour/ZeroConf/Avahi/mDNS service discovery + link-local/serverless XMPP (XEP-0174) demonstration that has two behaviors:

1. Connect serverless XMPP via Bonjour discovery, sends a chat message
   to predefined bonjour buddy, then disconnects and exits
   
2. Connect serverless XMPP via Bonjour discovery, waits a chat message
   from any bonjour buddy, sends an echo reply back, then disconnects and exits

h2. avahi-browse

Example avahi-browse output. The "iChat Presence" (aka @_presence._tcp@) is most interesting.

Pidgin immediately closes my XML stream connection attempt. I thought this was because I can't chat from the same host, but using Pidgin
it's possible to have two Bonjour accounts in the same host and talk between them.

bc. > nc -v localhost 5298
Connection to localhost 5298 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

Maybe Pidgin does a 5353 mDNS check on the PTR?
But it's a bit weird, as one cannot initiate a TCP connection from an already-listening port,
so a PTR check doesn't make sense.

Now I know why Pidgin/Bonjour isn't "stable" and misses messages a lot: due to IPv6.
Sometimes Bonjour IPv4 service isn't registered, only IPv6, so Pidgin tries to send
messages using the IPv6 address and the packet is lost.
